# Project Euler in JS
This is my repo for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). I hope that you use it only if you are stuck and you do not steal pleasure to solve the puzzle from youself.

To set up the repo up and running you will need LTS node and to install local dependecies:
```bash
$ npm i --save
```

There are a couple of tests, which can be run like:
```bash
$ npm test
```

Single problems can be run with:
```bash
$ node src/[number].js
```

Some of the problem can require time to get solved.
